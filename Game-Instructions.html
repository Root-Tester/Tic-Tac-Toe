    <h1>Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players alternate marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to place three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before your opponent does.
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-player Mode:</strong> Players can take turns to play as "X" or "O."</li>
        <li><strong>AI Mode:</strong> Play against a computer opponent, with the AI making moves based on predefined logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Win Detection:</strong> The game automatically checks for a winner after each move, detecting horizontal, vertical, and diagonal winning conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Tie Detection:</strong> If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.</li>
        <li><strong>Reset Option:</strong> The game provides an option to reset the board and start a new game.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive User Interface:</strong> The game is easy to play with simple click/tap interactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Game Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Players alternate turns.</li>
        <li>Player 1 is assigned "X" and Player 2 is assigned "O."</li>
        <li>A player wins by getting three of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
        <li>The game ends in a tie if the board is full and no player has won.</li>
        <li>After a win or tie, the game will prompt players to restart after clicking the window.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <h4>1. Starting a Game:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Upon launching the game, the player needs to select the mode: 2-player mode or Vs. Computer (if they want to play with AI). After this, the 3x3 grid will be displayed.</li>
        <li>Player 1 will go first and place "X" on the grid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Making a Move:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Players click on an empty cell to place their mark (either "X" or "O").</li>
        <li>The game will check if the move results in a win or tie.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Winning the Game:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The game will check if any player has succeeded in getting three marks in a row after each move.</li>
        <li>If a player wins, the game will display a message announcing the winner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Tie Game:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game will announce a tie.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Restarting the Game:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>After a game concludes, the player needs to tap or click any key to restart the game, resetting the grid for a new game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>

    <h4>Game Logic</h4>
    <p>The game checks for a win or tie after every move by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Checking all rows, columns, and diagonals for three identical marks.</li>
        <li>If a player places their mark in a winning position, the game ends and declares the winner.</li>
        <li>If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>User Interface (UI)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3x3 Grid:</strong> The board consists of 9 cells, with each cell initially empty.</li>
        <li><strong>Buttons:</strong> Players can click on any empty cell to place their mark.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages:</strong> After each game, the UI displays whether the game was won or tied.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Layout:</strong> The game layout dynamically adjusts based on the screen size, ensuring optimal playability on any device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Contains the structure of the game, including the 3x3 grid container where JavaScript dynamically generates the grid.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Defines the layout and appearance, including the responsive design rules for different screen sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Contains the logic for dynamically creating the game board, player moves, AI behavior, win/tie detection, and restarting the game.</li>
    </ul>
